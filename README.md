## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

# How to Run the Project 

1. Clone the repository (Note: If you know github well) from here and skip 2nd step
2. Download the Zip file of project (Note: If you don't know the Github well)
3. Run the index.html file in browser(Inside the project folder)
