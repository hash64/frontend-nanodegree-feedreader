## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


# Test that are implemented

* Tests whether allfeeds have been defined and they are not empty
* Tests whether allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
* Tests whether allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
* Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
* Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
* Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container
* Test ,when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes
